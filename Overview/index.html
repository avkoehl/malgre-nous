          <p class="myfont"> 
          <span class="dropcap">I</span>t is hard to quantify the cost of war on a population. Destructions, civilian and military casualties, refugees
          and number of people displaced, violations of human rights and civil liberties are all factors that need to be
          taken into account when trying to establish the impact of any conflict within a country. 
          The scope if this project fits within this framework; it is limited however to statistics on military casualties.
          The project seeks to determine total deaths and when and in which theatre of war the losses occurred. 
          Our objectives are multiple. First, we want to compare the number of casualties among the Malgre-Nous with
          the corresponding number of casualties within the German armies, for the period 1943 to 1945, both globally,
          and divided over the different fronts of the war. Our interest is to see if there were significant differences
          that could be connected to preferential treatment of the Malgr&eacute; Nous among German troups, and / or to
          deliberate choices of the German High Command when it comes to assigning the Malgr&eacute; Nous on specific assignments. Second,
          we establish a timeline for when the Malgr&eacute; Nous casualties occurred, and mapped those on the dynamic
          maps of the different fronts of the war. Such a visualization provides a better representation of the progressionof the war and its impact on a specific group of soldiers that numbers only cannot convey.
          More personal accounts of the war and its consequences on the Malgr&eacute; Nous and today's perception of their experiences will be provided in <a href="../Memoirs/index">the Memoir section</a> and in <a href="../Conclusions">the Discussion section</a> of this project, respectively.

          <p class="myfont">
          Our major sources of data on the Malgr&eacute; Nous come from the databases that were set up by the mission
          "Memory" of the region "Grand Est" of France. <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> 
          Those databases contain the names and biography of the Alsatian and Mosellan victims during
          the second World War, including those that were enrolled against their will
          in the German Armies, namely the Malgr&eacute; Nous. 
          More specifically, we scraped the data corresponding to the Malgr&eacute; Nous from the Western Archives section of the Memoires <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>. More information on this database is given in the <a href="../Methods/index.html">Methods section</a>. In November 2016, we built ou own database based on 23623 records from that
          database. 
          Each record includes information such as name, date and place of birth, date and place of disparition, as well as the reason for the disparition. Data are often incomplete. 21877 of those records contain information on the date of disparition. In parallel, we were able to geo-locate the place of disparition for 10150 of those records.
          Details on the procedure and code we have used for geocoding is available in the <a href="../Methods/index.html">Methods section</a>.

          Statistics on German World War II military casualties are divergent and contradictory. The primary source of data are usually the wartime military casualty figures compiled by German High Command. 
          However, a recent study by the German historian R&uuml;diger Overmans found that those German High Command statistics are not reliable <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. Here we rely on Overmans's estimates, as they resemble most with the data we have on the Malgr&eacute Nous. Overmans's estimates involved taking a statistical sample of the confidential German military personnel records. This sample consisted of 4,844 personnel dead or missing in military service during the war. Data derived from this sample are available in R&uuml;diger Overmans's book <sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup> and on Wikipedia <sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup>. It should be noted that we do not claim here that those data are more reliable than those from the German High Command. <!-- 2 REFERENCES TO SAME LINK... SUSPICIOUS -->

          <h3 class="it">The Malgr&eacute; Nous shared the plight of the German army </h3>
          <br>
          <p class="myfont">
          The conscription of the Malgr&eacute; Nous led to a complex situation for all
          parties concerned, from judicial, social, and personal point of views. Prior to
          1942 and the decrees enforcing the draft in the German armies of all young
          Alsatians and Mosellans, The Germans had encountered little success in attracting support from the populations living in Alsace and Moselle. There was a strong
          feeling of belonging to France within those populations. By making the draft
          compulsory, the Germans expected ALsatians to welcome being forced <sup><a "href=#ref5">[5]</a></sup>. Many Malgr&eacute; Nous however deserted the German Army or fled in order to join the French Resistance or escape to Switzerland (figures
          of up to 40,000 of such deserters have been proposed <sup><a href="#ref6">[6]></a></sup>). Those that deserted however ran the risk of having their families displaced on the Eastern borders of the German Reich, or even sent to concentration
          camps, mainly Natzweiler-Struthof, near the village of Natzwiller in Alsace.
          It is usually accepted that it is this fear of repraisal against their families
          that lead 130,000 young Alsatians and Mosellans to be drafted in the German armies between 1942 and 1944. How did the German Military High Command however dealt with those draftees? On one hand, they had a high demands of troups on the multiple fronts of the conflicts, mostly on the Eastern Front, while on the other hand they did have trust issues with the forced draftees that may decide to desert at any time. To attempt to answer those questions, we compared the number of casualties in the German Armies (included the forced draftees) and among the
          Malgr&eacute; Nous, both as a function of time during the War, and broken down into the multiple fronts of the War. Results are provided in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.</p>

          <p class="myfont">Figure 1 illustrated a remarkable similarity between evolutions of the numbers of casualties between 1943 and 1945 for the German Armies and
          the Malgr&eacute; Nous. Data for the German armies include the Wehrmacht, Waffen SS, Austrians, conscripted ethnic Germans (including the Malgr&eacute; Nous), Volkssturm, and other paramilitary forces. <sup><a href=#ref3">3</a></sup> Data for the Malgr&eacute; Nous include 21877 ALsatians and Mosellans for which the
          date of disparition is known. <sup><a href=#ref1">1</a></sup> We did remove however those whose place of disparition was either Tambov or Kirsanov, as those correspond to prisoner camps in Russia. The ratio between the two scales (blue for the Malgr&eacute; Nous and red for the German armies) is approximately 3%. Both curves show significant increase in the numbers of casualties during the period June-July 1944 and in January 1945. The first peak (summer 1944)
          corresponds to the formation of the Western front with the attack on Normandy on the Western side of France on June 6th, 1944, and to the offensive of the Russians on White Russia. The second peak (beginning of 1945) corresponds to the battle of the bulge in Belgium on the Western Front, and to the rapid advance of the Russian army through Poland and Eastern Germany. The high level of casualties
          in January 1943 in the German army that is not observed among the Malgr&eacute; Nous most likely corresponds to the end of the battle of Stalingrad, lost by the Germans, in which the Malgr&eacute; Nous were not involved.

            In Figure 2, we show the proportions of casualties over the main fronts of the Second World Wars, both for the German Armies and for the Malgr&eacute; Nous. The common knowledge is that the Malgr&eacute; Nous were mainly dispatched to help on the Eastern Front. Our data support this claim. Indeed, most of the Malgr&eacute; casualties occurred at the Eastern Front, with a higher proportion than
            in the German Armies (80% to 60%, respectively). In parallel, smaller fractions
            of the Malgr&eacute; Nous died on the Western Front, or in Germany during 1945,
            in comparison to overall German casualties. Both observations are not surprising. It is expected that the German High Command did not trust the Malgr&eacute; Nous in the battles in France in 1944, and German soldiers were defending their
            homeland in 1945. Interestingly, there were proportionally as many casualties among the Malgr&eacute; Nous than within the German army as a whoe on the smaller fronts of the conflict, including in Scandinavia.

          Clearly, the data shown in Figures 1 and 2 support the fact that overall, the Malgr&eacute; Nous went through the same war experiences as the German, being neither more nor less protected or exposed on the battlefield.

          <h3 class="it">Timeline of the Western and Eastern Fronts</h3>
          <p class="myfont">The maps used for presenting the involvment of the Malgr&eacute; Nous on the Eastern and Western fronts of the war in Europe are derived from
          The Atlas of the World Battle Fronts in Semimonthly Phases to May 15 1945. <sup><a href=#ref7>7</a></sup> This Atlas was produced for the Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1945.
          It shows the front lines of World War II in two-week steps between 1 July 1943 and 15 May 1945. Those maps were preprocessed so that it was possible to overlay the places of disparitions of the 10,150 Malgr&eacute; Nous for which this information was available (see the <a href="../Methods/index.html">Methods section</a> for a description of the processes that are involved). Note that those casualties were both direct (on the front), and indirect, including Malgr&eacute; Nous that died in field hospitals. We removed victims that died in Tambov and Kirsanov (the hospital near Tambov); it is however possible that there were casualties from other internment camps.</p>

          <p class="myfont">Each map shows the current state of the front line at that date, and the positions (blue dots) of all new Malgr&eacute; Nous casualties recorded in the two weeks that precede the date. The size of the blue dot is proportional to the number of Malgr&eacute; Nous that died at the corresponding spot.</p>

                  1943 marks an hinge year for the war in Europe. Germany had a severe drawback at the beginning of that year, losing the battle of Stalingrad, with its 6th army surrendering. Germany and its allies suffered 730,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) during that battle; these large losses led to a need to
                  find new troops, and ultimately to the drafting orders in Alsace and Lorraine that started the plight of the Malgr&eacute; Nous. In May 1943, the German troops and their allies capitulated in Northern Africa. On July 5th, the Germans pushed on the Eastern Front toward Kursk. During the night July 9-July 10 began
                  Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, a key island in the Mediterranean. 
                  Note the presence of Malgr&eacute; Nous casualties on each of those fronts. Note also
                  that some of those casualties are far from the front: they correspond to death
                  occuring either in hospital following injuries on the Western side of the Eastern Front, or in prisoner camps in Russia.

Kharkhov had kept changing hands between 1941 and summer 1943, being at the center of three
                  major battles. On the Western front, the Allies finished their conquest of Sicily in those first two weeks of August. However, the German and Italian troops

                  completed the liberation of Smolensk.
                  During that time, the resistant movements, with the help of troops sent from North Africa, and Italian fighters, finished liberating Corsica (on October 4th)
                  Sardinia also fell under the control of the Allies, albeit without fight as the Germans had left the island for Corsica just after the armistice signed by Italy on September 3rd.</p>

In parallel, the Germans lost many of their strongest units on the Western front in the Falaise pocket in Normandy, during the battle of Normandy. The battle of the Falaise pocket, from August 12 until Augist 21 was the decisive engagement during the battle of Normandy. In Italy, the Allies retook Florence.</p>

                  In addition to continuous fighting along the front line established at the end of operation Bagration, the Russians started a series of major offensive end of August as part of the battle of Romania. In the first stage, the Russians attacked through the territory of present-day Moldova, breaking and destroying the German Sixth Army. On August 23rd, King Michael of Romania led a coup d'Etat agains the ruling Primer Minister, that led to a new government that surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany. The German Eight Army retreated to Hungary, with heavy losses. After the battle of the Falaise gap (see early August), the Allies made fast progress on the Western front, taking Paris on August 25th.  In Italy, the Allies reached the Gothic line, North of Pisa, the last major defensive line of the Germans. In parallel, they opened a new front in Southern France on August 15, as part of operation Dragoon. The Germans withdrew fast North, up to the region of Dijon (in Burgundy).</p>

                  Of significance during the month of September on the Eastern Front is the uprising of Warsaw that
                  led to severe fighting between the Polish resistance and the German troops. Through operation Bagration, the Russian armies arrived close to Warsaw. The Polish resistance started a major uprising in the city of Warsaw on August 1st. The uprising lasted 60 days.... it was severely repressed by the German troops, leading to a nearly complete destruction of the city. The passivity of the Russian armies that could have moved in and help the resistance is often discussed as being intentional, as a way to allow for the Polish resistance to be reduced. On the Western fronts, the Allies freed most of France and Blegium during that period, with the two fronts from operation Overlord (from Normandy) and operation Draggon (from South of France) rejoining. In Italy, the Allies were still blocked at the Gothic line, North of Pisa.</p>

                  During the summer 1944, the Russians conducted the large Bagration offensive that threw back the Germans from Belorussia to Poland. This created the opportunity for the Russians to attack towards the Baltic sea, resulting in the Baltic offensive during Autumn 1944. This offensive covered a series of operations, two of which two place during those last two weeks of September: the Riga offensive (14 September till 24 October) whose goals were to liberate Riga and the shores of the Gulf of Riga, and the Tallin offensive (17-26 September), to drive the German forces from mainland Estonia (Tallin was captured on September 22nd). OF significance during the same period is the Moscow Armistice of September 19th signed by Finland and the Soviet Union (and United Kingdom) that ended the was between the USSR and Finland. As a consequence, the Finnish army was required to fight and force the German Army to leave Finland. In Poland, combats were still intense in Warsaw. In the South, the Russians were pushing west, taking Sofia in Bulgaria on September 16th. On The Western front, the Allies have reached the Siegfried Line, the defensive line along the Western borders of Germany that was going all the way fron the Netherlands to Karlsruhe. Nancy is liberated on September 19th.
                  In Italy, the Allies slowly moves North of the Gothic line, taking Rimini on September 18.</p>

Fighting between Germans and Polish resistance was still strong near Warsaw. On the Western front, the Allies liberated most of Belgium and had reached the Vosge mountains.

The same day, Strasbourg is liberated by French troops led by General Leclerc. By the end of November 1944, the US Armies had pushed the Germans back across the Rhine and behind its own borders. The only remaining German units west of the Rhine in the southern region were around the Alsace city of Colmar, in the French sector. This is the so colled "pocket of Colmar".

                  The Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region on December 16. The surprise attack caught the Allied forces completely off guard. American forces incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war. The German intentions were to stop the Allies from using the port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines. The battles were fierce, involving massacres (such as Malmedy and Chenogne) that are still under scrutiny today. The Germans benefited from the bad weather in that region first, which would prevent the Allies airforce to intervne. The weather cleared un around December 23rd. The German advances were effectively stalled right after that. On the Eastern front, the siege of Budapest, also called the battle of Budapest started on December 26. It would last for 50 days, with the unconditional surrender of the city on February 13, 1945.</p>

                  On January 12th, the Russian army started the Vistual-Oder offensive in Poland. After a few months pausing along the Vistual river, during which they built up their strengths (it is estimated theat they had 5 times more troops than the opposite German armies), the Russians started their offensive toward Berlin, moving fast through Poland. They took Warsaw on January 17th, though the city was just rubbles after the severe fighting during the Warsaw uprisal by the Polish resistance during fall 1944. In the south, the battle of Budapest was still ongoing, while on the Western front, Germans and Allies were still fighting in the Ardennes, as part of the Battle of the Bulge. On December 31, 1944, the Germans started operation North Wind in Alsace and Lorraine to break through the lines of the Allies, retake the Alsatian plain and the Upper Vosges mountain. The operation lasted until January 25th, with a tactical withdrawal from the Allied forces.</p>

                  May 1945 marks the endof the war in Europe. The Battle of Berlin edned on May 2nd. On May 4th, the German forces in North West Germany, Denmark, and the Neterlands surrendered. The same day, German forces surrendered in Bavaria. On May 5th, 1945, the Czech resistance started the Prague uprising and the following day, the Russians started the Prague offensive, that last major Soviet operation of World War II in Europe. The battle for prague was fought from May 6th till May 11th, i.e. after Germany had capitulated. German forces in Breslau surrendered on May 6th. On May 7th, General Alfred Jodl, signed an unconditional surrender document for all German forces to the Allies in Reims, France. The  document stipulated that hostilities would end at 23hours on May 8th. The next day, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel and other German OKW representatives travelled to Berlin, and shortly before midnight signed an amended and definitive document of unconditional surrender, explicitly surrendering to all the Allied forces. The war was not fully over however for the Malgr&eacute; Nous, as many were interned in prisoners' camps on the Western Front and in Russia, where they were mainly in Tambov. Many only came home in 1946 or 1947, with the last to come back in 1955.</p>
