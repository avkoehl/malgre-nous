                  1943 marks an hinge year for the war in Europe. Germany had a severe drawback at the beginning of that year, losing the battle of Stalingrad, with its 6th army surrendering. Germany and its allies suffered 730,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) during that battle; these large losses led to a need to
                  find new troops, and ultimately to the drafting orders in Alsace and Lorraine that started the plight of the Malgr&eacute; Nous. In May 1943, the German troops and their allies capitulated in Northern Africa. On July 5th, the Germans pushed on the Eastern Front toward Kursk. During the night July 9-July 10 began
                  Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, a key island in the Mediterranean. 
                  Note the presence of Malgr&eacute; Nous casualties on each of those fronts. Note also
                  that some of those casualties are far from the front: they correspond to death
                  occuring either in hospital following injuries on the Western side of the Eastern Front, or in prisoner camps in Russia.

                  after the armistice, started the liberation of Corsica.</p>

                  On 15 September 1943, Hitler ordered his armies to retreat to the Dnieper defence line: the Germans had realized that they could not hold against the Russian on the flat terrain of the Ukraine; instead, they prefer to retreat and fortify ththemselves at the level of the Dniepr river. On September 25, the Russians 
                  completed the liberation of Smolensk.

                  Sardinia also fell under the control of the Allies, albeit without fight as the Germans had left the island for Corsica just after the armistice signed by Italy on September 3rd.</p>

It should be noted that the Germans were able to escape the so-called Kamianets-Podilskyi pocket, in stark comparison with the disasters at Stalingrad (December 1942 - January 1943) and during the battles of the bulge of Korsun (January-February 1944). In Italy, the Allies had established a beach head in Anzeo, just South of Rome.</p>

In parallel, on April 8, the Russians started the Crimean Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Crimea, as an effort to retake Crimea.

                  Near Leningrad, the Russians started on June 10 the Karelian offensive to put pressure on Finland (still at war against the USSR); they captured East Karelia and Viborg. In May-June 1944, the Iasi area in Eastern Romania became the scene of ferocious fighting between Romanian-German forces and the advancing Red Army; the city was partially destroyed.
                  In Italy, the Allies, not that they had captured Rome, started pushing towards Northern Italy. The main even however during the first two weeks of June is the opening of the Western Front, with the allies debarking in Normandy on D-day, i.e. June 6th. The battles that resulted from this landing were fierce. Of significance, on 10 June 1944, the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in Haute-Vienne, South of France, was destroyed, when 642 of its inhabitants, including women and children, were massacred by a Nazi Waffen-SS company. This SS-company included 14 Alsatians, 13 of which were self-declared Malgr&eacute; Nous.</p>

                  On June 22nd, the Russians started operation Bagration, also called the Belorussian Strategic Offensive Operation. This was a general attack by Russian forces to clear the German forces from Belarus. It lasted until August 1944, resulting in the destruction of the German Army Group Centre, possibly the greatest defeat of the Wehrmacht during World War II. In June, the Bagration operation included three main offensives, the Vitbesk-Orsha offensive in the region of Vitbesk,
                  the Mogilev offensive, and the Bobruysk offensive, all in Belorussia (also called White Russia. In Italy, the allies were slowly moving North, while in France on the Western Front, fights was fierce in Normandy, with the Allies progrssing in small steps.</p>

The objective was reached on July 4th. The most significant element of that offensive however was that the German Army Group Centre lost close to 300,000 men. Still part of operation Bagration, the Russians started the Linius offensive on July 5th. It lasted until July 13, with a Russian victory and the city of Vilius being recaptured.
                  In Italy, the Allies made steady progress going North. In Normandy, the Allies consolidated their beach heads, landing more trrops on the beaches that had been liberated. They encountered however severe resistance from the Germans.</p>

                  The Bagration operation concluded mid August. During those last two weeks, the Russians engaged into more offensive, mostly the Kaunas offensive (that was retaken on August 1st), and the Osovets offensive, with the objective of the area of Osowiec in East Prussia. Germans however were able to stabilise their line of defence there (along the Narew river) that would hold until January 1945.
                  Again, the Bagration operation was the greatest Russian victory in terms of numbers. The Germans lost about a quarter of their Eastern front manpower and would never recover from this. In parallel, the Germans lost many of their strongest units on the Western front in the Falaise pocket in Normandy, during the battle of Normandy. The battle of the Falaise pocket, from August 12 until Augist 21 was the decisive engagement during the battle of Normandy. In Italy, the Allies retook Florence.</p>

In the first stage, the Russians attacked through the territory of present-day Moldova, breaking and destroying the German Sixth Army. On August 23rd, King Michael of Romania led a coup d'Etat agains the ruling Primer Minister, that led to a new government that surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany. The German Eight Army retreated to Hungary, with heavy losses. After the battle of the Falaise gap (see early August), the Allies made fast progress on the Western front, taking Paris on August 25th.  In Italy, the Allies reached the Gothic line, North of Pisa, the last major defensive line of the Germans. In parallel, they opened a new front in Southern France on August 15, as part of operation Dragoon. The Germans withdrew fast North, up to the region of Dijon (in Burgundy).</p>

                  Of significance during the month of September on the Eastern Front is the uprising of Warsaw that
                  led to severe fighting between the Polish resistance and the German troops. Through operation Bagration, the Russian armies arrived close to Warsaw. The Polish resistance started a major uprising in the city of Warsaw on August 1st. The uprising lasted 60 days.... it was severely repressed by the German troops, leading to a nearly complete destruction of the city. The passivity of the Russian armies that could have moved in and help the resistance is often discussed as being intentional, as a way to allow for the Polish resistance to be reduced. On the Western fronts, the Allies freed most of France and Blegium during that period, with the two fronts from operation Overlord (from Normandy) and operation Draggon (from South of France) rejoining. In Italy, the Allies were still blocked at the Gothic line, North of Pisa.</p>

                  During the summer 1944, the Russians conducted the large Bagration offensive that threw back the Germans from Belorussia to Poland. This created the opportunity for the Russians to attack towards the Baltic sea, resulting in the Baltic offensive during Autumn 1944. This offensive covered a series of operations, two of which two place during those last two weeks of September: the Riga offensive (14 September till 24 October) whose goals were to liberate Riga and the shores of the Gulf of Riga, and the Tallin offensive (17-26 September), to drive the German forces from mainland Estonia (Tallin was captured on September 22nd). OF significance during the same period is the Moscow Armistice of September 19th signed by Finland and the Soviet Union (and United Kingdom) that ended the was between the USSR and Finland. As a consequence, the Finnish army was required to fight and force the German Army to leave Finland. In Poland, combats were still intense in Warsaw. In the South, the Russians were pushing west, taking Sofia in Bulgaria on September 16th. On The Western front, the Allies have reached the Siegfried Line, the defensive line along the Western borders of Germany that was going all the way fron the Netherlands to Karlsruhe. Nancy is liberated on September 19th.
                  In Italy, the Allies slowly moves North of the Gothic line, taking Rimini on September 18.</p>

Fighting between Germans and Polish resistance was still strong near Warsaw. On the Western front, the Allies liberated most of Belgium and had reached the Vosge mountains.

                  The Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) was the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region on December 16. The surprise attack caught the Allied forces completely off guard. American forces incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war. The German intentions were to stop the Allies from using the port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines. The battles were fierce, involving massacres (such as Malmedy and Chenogne) that are still under scrutiny today. The Germans benefited from the bad weather in that region first, which would prevent the Allies airforce to intervne. The weather cleared un around December 23rd. The German advances were effectively stalled right after that. On the Eastern front, the siege of Budapest, also called the battle of Budapest started on December 26. It would last for 50 days, with the unconditional surrender of the city on February 13, 1945.</p>

After a few months pausing along the Vistual river, during which they built up their strengths (it is estimated theat they had 5 times more troops than the opposite German armies), the Russians started their offensive toward Berlin, moving fast through Poland.

In the south, the battle of Budapest was still ongoing, while on the Western front, Germans and Allies were still fighting in the Ardennes, as part of the Battle of the Bulge. On December 31, 1944, the Germans started operation North Wind in Alsace and Lorraine to break through the lines of the Allies, retake the Alsatian plain and the Upper Vosges mountain. The operation lasted until January 25th, with a tactical withdrawal from the Allied forces.</p>

                  Over the two last weeks of January 1945, the Russian armies advanced 300 miles from the Vistula to the Oder, stopping at only 43 miles from Berlin. The reasons that the Russians decided to stop is still being debated. Their successes were consequences of both the Vistula-Oder and the East Prussian offensives.
                  The reached and freed Warsaw on January 17 and Lodz on January 19.
                  Some cities however in the path of the Russian advances led to strong resistance from the Germans, having been declared as "Festung" (German: fortresses, also strongholds) such as Poznan: battle of Poznan from January 24 till February 25.
                  Of significance, on January 27th, the Russian army liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp, finding graphic evidence of the Holocaust.
                  On the Western front, the Battle of the Bulge ended on January 25th. While the Allies won that battle, their plans to move inside Germany were delayed by 5 to 6 weeks. This battle exhausted however the German resources on that front, leading to a collapse of the Siegfried line.</p>

                  On the Eastern Front, the Russians concluded the East Pomenerian Offensive. They took Danzig on March 1945, and launched the Altdamm Offensive (18 March - 4 April) near Stettin.
